/**
 * The engine's persistence boundary. Each method is its own short transaction, so
 * the {@link ExecutionEngine} — which orchestrates on a worker thread and may sleep
 * for delays or park for approvals — never holds a database connection open across
 * a wait. Every state change the engine makes is committed immediately, so a
 * concurrent monitor read (or the SSE snapshot) always sees live progress.
 *
 * <p>These reads are intentionally <em>not</em> org-scoped: the engine only ever
 * acts on an execution id that {@code ExecutionService} already resolved within the
 * caller's tenant. Tenant isolation lives at the service edge, not here.
