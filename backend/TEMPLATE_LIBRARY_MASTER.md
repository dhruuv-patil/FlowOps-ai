# FlowOps Production Template Library

## Research Summary

### What Real Users Repeatedly Automate

Based on analysis of n8n, Zapier, Make, Temporal, and AI agent platforms, real users repeatedly automate:

1. **DevOps/Engineering Operations** - CI/CD pipelines, deployment automation, incident response, infrastructure monitoring, GitHub/GitLab automation
2. **Revenue Operations (RevOps)** - Lead enrichment/routing, CRM sync, deal progression, quote-to-cash, commission calculations
3. **Customer Support Operations** - Ticket triage, escalation, SLA monitoring, knowledge base updates, customer communication
4. **AI Operations (AIOps)** - Model monitoring, prompt evaluation, agent orchestration, LLM cost tracking, output validation
5. **Reliability/Incident Management** - Alert correlation, runbook execution, post-incident review, chaos engineering, SLO tracking
6. **Security/Access Operations** - Access requests, vulnerability scanning, compliance checks, audit trails, secret rotation
7. **Data/Document Operations** - ETL pipelines, report generation, document processing, data reconciliation, backup verification
8. **Business Operations** - Employee onboarding/offboarding, expense approval, contract management, vendor management

### Where Existing Template Libraries Are Repetitive

- **Zapier/n8n**: Overwhelmingly "Trigger A → Action B" patterns (webhook→Slack, form→email, GitHub→Slack)
- **Missing**: Multi-system reconciliation, partial failure handling, AI confidence gating, human approval chains, idempotency patterns, saga compensation
- **Demo-heavy**: Most templates are 3-5 nodes showing feature capability, not production resilience

### What Production Workflows Require That Simple Templates Ignore

1. **Idempotency at webhook boundaries** - duplicate event handling
2. **Multi-system reconciliation** - CRM vs billing, deployment vs incident state
3. **AI uncertainty handling** - confidence thresholds, schema validation, human review gates
4. **Partial failure compensation** - Step A succeeds, B succeeds, C fails → rollback A/B
5. **Observability-first design** - specific anomaly conditions, not generic "monitoring"
6. **Recovery strategies** - dead letter, manual requeue, compensating actions, escalation

### FlowOps Differentiation Opportunities

- Built-in reliability primitives: `circuit_breaker`, `rate_limiter`, `idempotency_check`, `dead_letter_queue`, `anomaly_detector`, `incident_creator`
- AI investigation of anomalies with evidence packages
- Recovery verification (N healthy runs before auto-resolve)
- External workflow provider telemetry sync (n8n, GitHub Actions, Make)
- Human approval with audit trail and timeout escalation
