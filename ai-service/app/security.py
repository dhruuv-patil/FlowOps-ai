"""Service-to-service authentication for the AI endpoints.

The AI service is never exposed to the browser — only the Spring backend calls
it, presenting the shared ``AI_SERVICE_TOKEN`` in the ``X-Service-Token`` header.
This dependency enforces that on every ``/ai/*`` route.

When no token is configured on this service the check is skipped (local dev
convenience); as soon as a token is set it is required and compared in constant
time. The token itself is never logged or echoed.
